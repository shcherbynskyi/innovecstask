# Context

We should run WorkManager task each 15 minutes and show/update the notification each "tick", with
the corresponding information about when was the latest boot completed, how much boot completed events
were there, etc.

Responsibility of a broadcast receiver is just to receive BOOT_COMPLETED event and pass it to the
application to store/use in the future. Responsibility of a work manager is to get this information
about the latest boot completed event and show the notification with the corresponding info (each 15 minutes).


# Steps (WIP)

1. Register receiver that receives BOOT_COMPLETED action (done) and save the event's timestamp (not done)
2. Start WorkManager that shows/updates notification each 15 minutes in onStart() method of MainActivity (partially done) - it took me a while to learn more about WorkManager
3. Show notification with the latest boot received event data, etc (not done)
4. Make sure to save boot received event data in the database (not done)
5. Verify on my end (not done, since all the previous steps are not done)
